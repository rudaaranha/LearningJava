# LearningJava
Learning Java through the CurseemVideo course by professor Gustavo Guanabara.

In this course I learned about Java history, how to install software and basic Java fundamentals, how to create swing projects divided in 15 classes.

The course is divided in: primitive types, data input and output, class math, arithmetic, unary, ternary, relational and logical operators.
In addition to conditional structures, repetition structures, vectors, functions and exercises.
